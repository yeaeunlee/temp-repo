Open Source 2nd Lecture

1. Create branch
Click the Main function button creates "my-first-branch"

2. Make file
Enter the My-first-branch, write "Welcome to my GitHub profile!" 
Name the file "Add PROFILE.md ".

3. Consolidating Files
In Open requests, my-first-branch is integrated into the main function.
Make ‘Base : main <- Compare : my-first-branch’
Write create ‘pull request’ -> ‘Merge pull request’ -> "Add my first file" in order and ‘confirm merge’ -> ‘Delete branch’ (because ‘my-first-branch’ data is stored in the main function)
